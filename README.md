# Predicting-the-next-event-in-business-process

In this work, we benchmark a bunch of classification algorithms spanning from different families for predictive monitoring. We take into account a particular use case, i.e. the next activity prediction in business process.
Six event log data sets, i.e. Helpdesk, BPI2012, BPI2013 Incidents, Sepsis, Road Traffic Fine Management, and Hospital Billing are included in our experiment.

We attached pre-processed event logs for future research.
